syntax: regexp

# The intent of this regular expression was to ignore all executable files.
# Unfortunately, it ignores a lot more because it also matches directory names,
# and hg will then ignore everything in or below that directory.
#
# But even though it doesn't do what I want, it's useful so that hg stat doesn't
# print a long list of files that it isn't tracking, which I know about and don't
# care about.
